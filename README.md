## Backend Development Milestone Project 3 - Shared Cookbook
Shared Cookbook is a recipe website for people who loves cooking and enjoys sharing recipes. 

The website is design to have a place to save my favarite recipes and inspire people for sharing theirs too.

The website can be access by here.

## UX

### As a user
- When I open the website home page it will clearly shows the recipe image cards.
- I can search for recipes.
- I can easily access recipe content.
- I can signup/register or sign out to the website.
- I can add, edit and delete my own recipes once signed in.

### As a website owner
- When I searched recipe websites I always like the ones that are simple and straight forward. So for this website I wanted the samething.
- This website can be my own recipe collection site for all the recipes I like.
- I want users to enjoy cooking and share their own recipes.
